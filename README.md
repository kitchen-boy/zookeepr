# DESCRIPTION:
* Created a web server using the Express.js framework, i.e. back end application: to handle data management requests from the existing front-end application already created.  
* This web server was for a front-end application called Zoo Keepr and the application was deployed to Heroku, a cloud application platform that allows you to deploy applications with servers to a webpage.
* This site's data will be stored on this web server, which will allow animal enthusiasts to access the data from different locations and browsers without needing to download it to their device.

# TASK COMPLETED: 
After completing this module (11: Express.js), we learned how to:
1. Configure an Express.js app to handle GET and POST requests.
2. Configure an Express.js app to serve static files.
3. Identify how client-side requests relate to server-side responses.
4. Parse optional and required parameters when creating server-side routes.
5. Implement client-side POST requests to submit form data to a server.
6. Implement separation of concerns for routing.
7. Deploy a server-side application to the Heroku platform.

# USER STORY:
```md
AS A zoo administrator
I WANT to have access back-end, a web server using the Express.js framework to handle data management with the site's data
SO THAT anyone can access it without having to download it 
```
# ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
```md
```

# INSTALLATION SETUP
**MANDATORY REQUIREMENT FOR SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION:**  **NODE.JS MUST BE INSTALLED!**

1. Download all files from the repository.
2. CD into the repository.
3. Run this command to install [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
```md
npm install express
```
4. Run this command to install [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
```md
npm install jest
```
6. Run this command to run the application
```md
node index.js
```

# Tools Used:
* [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It is considered the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

Insomnia (https://insomnia.rest/) is a powerful REST API client that allows us to test APIs and make client-side server requests without having to use a browser. 
* Used Insomnia to test API, NOT insomnia Desiter.
